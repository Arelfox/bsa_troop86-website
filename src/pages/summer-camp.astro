      <h1>Summer Camp</h1>
      <p>
        We canâ€™t emphasize enough how important summer camp is for your son's scouting and life experience.
        He builds relationships, becomes part of a team, learns independence, is given and we hope learns responsibility,
        and last but not least has a great time. TMR is a great opportunity for the boys to earn merit badges,
        work on their rank advancement, but more importantly, have lots of fun. This is a very important week for the boys,
        and we encourage all scouts to attend.
