# how to use astro
## install packages
astro requires node
after that just use `npm create astro@latest` cli is very user friendly

`npm install papaparse` for csv parsing (needed for honor roll and calendar)
`npx astro add react` for react support (needed for calendar)
## run
`npm run dev` to start local development server
## todo
make some pages feel less sparse
make it easier to do trivial update edits just like how calendar and honor roll are done
